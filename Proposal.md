# Computer Science 30 Major Poject: Proposal
## Description 
  I prefer login games, so I want to make a bloxorz using Processing, a game where the objective is to move a block through a hole on a grid, and the player moves by using the arrow keys to flip a block onto it's side, avoiding obstacles. If the block (2 units x 1 unit x 1 unit) moves off the grid, the player has to start over. There are a lot of other aspects to the game in later levels, such as switches to turn on bridges if the grid/gameboard is seperated, teleportation doors, and different coloured tiles that break once the block has been on it once. It's a bit hard to describe, but here's a link: http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz 
## Timeline
  April 14 - April 27: Program the player block to move in a 3-D manner
  April 27 - May 4: Create the grid/gameboard
  May 4 - May 18: Put the two aspects together and make the game function
  May 18 - June 4: Create multiple levels
  June 4 +: Add special effects
## Must Have List
- [ ] Start Screen/Insctruction Screen/Death Screen/Win Screen
- [ ] Programming a block to move in a 3-D manner
- [ ] Setting up the grid layout/gameboard
- [ ] Combining the player block and gameboard into a simple but functioning game
- [ ] Multiple levels

## Nice to Have List
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Extra special effects
