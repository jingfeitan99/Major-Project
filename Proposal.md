# Computer Science 30 Major Poject: Proposal
## Description 
  I prefer login games, and my favourite kind of math is geometry, so I want to make a bloxorz using Processing, a game where the objective is to move a block through a hole on a grid, and the player moves by using the arrow keys to flip a block onto it's side, avoiding obstacles. If the block (2 units x 1 unit x 1 unit) moves off the grid, the player has to start over. There are a lot of other aspects to the game in later levels, such as switches to turn on bridges if the grid/gameboard is seperated, teleportation doors, and different coloured tiles that break once the block has been on it once. I think the most challenging part to get past is programming the block to move onto it's sides in a 3D manner, but after that, programming the detection for the rectangular block on the grid should be a challenge too. I hope to make quite a few levels with increasing difficulty and special effects (switches, bridges, teleportation tiles), to make the game as a whole more challenging and fun, but that will be left for the "Nice-to-Have's" list.

## Timeline
  April 14 - April 27: Program the player block to move in a 3-D manner
  April 27 - May 4: Create the grid/gameboard
  May 4 - May 18: Put the two aspects together and make the game function
  May 18 - June 4: Create multiple levels
  June 4 +: Add special effects
